# MCP platform adapter

`platform/mcp.py` implements the concrete JSON-RPC `tools/call` transport.
It exposes the five READ tools and the five existing WRITE tools from the
sealed ToolCatalog. The facade is synchronous because the frozen precondition
and verification reader protocol is synchronous; ToolRegistry runs sync
handlers in worker threads, so READ batches remain concurrent at the Runtime
boundary.

External responses remain raw untrusted data until Tool Runtime ingress takes
the canonical snapshot and applies the existing strict result/provenance/
evidence contracts. READ transport failures are bounded and side-effect-free.
WRITE timeout/5xx outcomes are conservatively `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`; known 4xx or
tool errors are `FAILED_BEFORE_EFFECT`.

The local integration suite uses a fake JSON-RPC server to prove READ, approval
pause, rejected WRITE with zero mutation, approved WRITE exactly once, and
post-write verification.
